My Poem about minions
Oh Gru, oh Gru, so silly and sweet, With your little Minions at your feet! They dance and they prance, they giggle and sway, In their matching yellow overalls all day. Your evil plans may not always succeed, But with your Minions, you're never beat! They'll steal some cheese or pull off a heist, All while looking adorable in their twist. From the Bank of Evil to the Moon, Your Minions will follow you soon. Through jungles and oceans, high and low, Gru and his Minions will go! So here's to you, dear Gru, our villainous friend, May your schemes turn out just as planned again and again! And to your Minions, we give a cheer, For being the best (and cutest) accomplices near!
